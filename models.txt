 (e.g., "scheduled," "in progress," "completed," "canceled," etc.).

Rescheduling and Cancellation: Allow users to reschedule or cancel appointments and handle
the necessary updates and notifications.

Overlapping Appointments: Implement a feature to handle overlapping appointments and provide
options for users to resolve conflicts.

Availability Management: Allow doctors to set their availability and working hours to prevent
 scheduling appointments during non-working hours.

Patient Portal: Create a patient portal where patients can view their upcoming appointments,
past appointments, and other relevant information.

Doctor Dashboard: Provide doctors with a dashboard where they can view their daily, weekly,
or monthly schedule and manage their appointments efficiently.

Appointment History: Keep a log of appointment changes and updates, such as rescheduling,
cancellations, and reasons for changes.

Multi-language and Timezone Support: If your application is used in multiple regions,
consider adding support for different languages and time zones.

Waiting List: Implement a waiting list feature for patients to be added to a queue if there
are no available appointments on their preferred date and time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance Billing Integration: When creating a billing record, allow the user to associate it with an
insurance provider. This way, the hospital can track payments from different insurance companies for specific patients.

Insurance Payment Status: Enhance the Billing model to include an additional field to track the status of
insurance payment (e.g., "pending," "paid," "rejected," etc.). This will provide better insights into the billing
and payment process for insurance claims.

Insurance Reports: Create reports that summarize billing and payment information for different insurance providers.
These reports could include details like the total amount billed to each insurance company, the amount paid,
outstanding amounts, and the status of insurance claims.

Dashboard Analytics: Develop a dashboard with graphs and charts that display key metrics related to insurance billing.
This can include a visual representation of the total billing amounts, payments received, and pending insurance claims.

Claim Re-submission: Allow the hospital staff to resubmit rejected insurance claims with corrections and additional
information, helping improve the claim acceptance rate and reducing the time taken to receive payments.

Automated Claim Processing: Explore the possibility of integrating with insurance companies' APIs to automate claim
processing. This would enable real-time submission and processing of insurance claims directly from the hospital management system.

Claim Validation Rules: Implement validation rules to ensure that billing information is accurate and complete before
submitting claims to insurance providers. This will help avoid claim rejections due to missing or incorrect information.

Insurance Provider Management: Build functionalities to manage insurance providers, allowing users to add, edit, or
deactivate insurance providers as needed.

Claim Status Notifications: Set up automated notifications to alert relevant staff about the status of insurance claims.
For example, send notifications when a claim is approved, rejected, or when payments are received.

Claim Aging Analysis: Create a feature to analyze the aging of insurance claims, helping the hospital identify
long-pending claims that require attention or follow-up.

Claim Audit Trail: Implement an audit trail to track any changes made to billing records associated with insurance
claims. This ensures accountability and transparency in case of any discrepancies or disputes.

-------------------------

 Low Stock Notification:

The application periodically checks the quantity available for each pharmacy item against its threshold quantity.
If the quantity available falls below the threshold, the application generates a low stock notification.
The notification can be sent to administrators or relevant personnel to take appropriate actions, such as restocking the item.
